switch_master.py is a program for configuring and controlling one or more switches via telnet session. Switches are usually either relays or solid state relays but can be anything that is abstractly considered a switch.

A json file controls the initial setup of all switches connected to the host. It is broken down by switch, each switch containing a number of pins. 
Each pin has a pin name for the Arduino board, has an active drive state, and additionally contains an alias for which it is known by the system of switches.
